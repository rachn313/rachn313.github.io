         <p>I have two brothers, we are triplets! I love to read books and draw when I get the chance. 
         Another passion of mine is photography. 
         I mostly shoot digital nowadays, but throughout high school I experimented with analog photography classes, 
         using traditional black and white film, and color film. Recently, I started dabbling with polaroid photography as well. 
         I prefer tropical weather (despite living in cold weather areas all my life). I'm a true "foodie" at heart. 
         I love strawberry cake, and pretty much every dessert on the planet! I also love trying new cuisines, and 
         expiriencing different cultures when traveling. I am caring, motivated, open-minded, and passionate. 
         I have strong work ethics and I am accountable for my work. I like to plan events in advance and 
         I enjoy collaborating with others. I am not afraid to ask questions and present new ideas. 
         I am open to constructive feedback, striving to grow, improve and learn new things.</p>

    <p> I am currently interested in learning new technologies such as mobile app development, UX/UI design. I am also exploring
        product management and design, and entrepreneurship.

         <span style="font-style: italic;">Whackathon Project: Froodie</span>
         <p> 
                This web application, Froodie, was designed with three fellow Wellesley women (Jun Ru, Marinn, Sandra) for Wackathon, 
                Wellesley's anual hackathon. A portmanteau word I created, combining "free" and "foodie" together, Froodie was born. 
                Froodie was designed to leviate food waste, and give access to free food for those who need it or want it. Users 
                can input a food location or search the latest food submissions. This website was live for about a year with a free 
                domain name. Our team won "best-food related hack" and "best domain name" awards. I worked primarily front-end, 
                using HTML, CSS, and Canva for graphic design elements. If we ever were to implement this application for real world use, I think we would create an ios/ android application for use on college campuses as a pilot project.</p>

         <span style="font-style: italic;"> CS230: Data Structures Final Project, Tap Tap Revolution</span>
         <p> Constructed a GUI application-based animated game using Java. Users earn points when "tapping" the
                keyboard at the appropriate time to successfully play the note sounds. The song I constructed was 
                the Star Wars Theme, using Garage Band and .wav files. Scores can be recorded and seen iteratively
                under the score history tab. Instructions can also be found when opening the application.
                I learned a lot about Java's animation library and working on a project with others through proposal, 
                design, and eventually the final product.

         <span style="font-style: italic;">Wellesley Computational Chemistry Lab: Research Assistant</span>
         <p>In order to understand cellular processes that regulate all life, we must study how molecules recognize and interact with 
             each other in the complex cellular environment. By learning more about these important molecular interactions, scientists 
             can develop more potent drugs that improve quality of life. Cells are highly crowded environments, with up to 40% of the 
             cells’ total volume occupied by macromolecules. Many computational and experimental studies, however, treat biomolecular 
             interactions as if they happen in dilute solution, without accounting for their complex environment. Studies have shown 
             that macromolecular crowding affects molecular interactions. This study aims to create and evaluate multiple computational 
             models for the cellular environment. The specific interacting model system we are using is Buforin II (BF2), an 
             antimicrobial peptide (AMP) that binds to bacterial DNA, disrupting intracellular processes that are essential for cell 
             survival. We use computational methods to study how different crowding models influence the binding between BF2 and DNA.
              Analyses conducted thus far show that crowding creates a more favorable interaction between BF2 and DNA. In addition to 
              developing and evaluating models to efficiently and accurately model the complex cellular environment, our study will 
              provide further insight into developing stronger antimicrobial peptides to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. 
              I used Python, iOS terminal to store data and submit jobs to the CPU prossessers that live on campus (named Iron, 
              Fluorine, Chlorine, and Calcium). I also learned some MATLAB features to visualize the data.

               <p> As self-proclaimed foodies, we struggle to find appetizing and aesthetic dishes at restaurants. 
                   Many social media applications lack features that make the enjoyment of sharing food photos possible. 
                   We found that Pinterest lacked information on where food photos were taken, like restaurant location or
                    what the dish was called. Yelp contains reviews of restaurants only, and not specific dishes served at 
                    those restaurants. It lacks that appeal that instagram food shots achieve. It seemed like these social 
                    media applications all had features that were needed on one platform. As a result, Feed combines the best 
                    of social media (e.g. Instagram, Pinterest, Yelp),such as looking up dish reviews and pricing, and 
                    filtering/searching through content, searching through users and their posts. 
                    I worked on users, which included login/sign up sessions,
                   profile page. Users can customize their profile picture (default is an avocado), change their
                   username, email, and display name. I also worked on the followers/following system for the website.
                   I also worked on the feature for liking/unliking posts. I also added a logout button to the navigation bar.
